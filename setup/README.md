## How to Use
#### **Step 1: Upload Files**
Upload the necessary files to the `public` directory of your Laravel application.

#### **Step 2: Modify `index.php`**
You have two options:
- **Overwrite** the existing `index.php` file.
- **Manually insert** the following code at the beginning of your `public/index.php` file:
  ```php
  //// KYNAR NETWORK LARAVEL INSTALLER START ////
  function loadEnv() {
      $envPath = __DIR__ . '/../.env';
      if (!file_exists($envPath)) {
          return [];
      }

      $lines = file($envPath, FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES | FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES);
      $envVariables = [];

      foreach ($lines as $line) {
          if (strpos(trim($line), '#') === 0 || strpos(trim($line), '=') === false) continue; // Skip comments and invalid lines
          list($name, $value) = explode('=', $line, 2);
          $envVariables[trim($name)] = trim($value, '"\'');
      }

      return $envVariables;
  }

  function env($key, $default = null) {
      static $envVariables = [];
      if (empty($envVariables)) {
          $envVariables = loadEnv();
      }
      return isset($envVariables[$key]) ? $envVariables[$key] : $default;
  }

  $envPath = '../.env';

  $dbConfigured = file_exists($envPath) && env('DB_CONNECTION') !== false;
  $appKeySet = env('APP_KEY') !== null;

  if (!$dbConfigured || !$appKeySet) {
      header("Location: /setup/index.php");
      exit;
  }
  //// KYNAR NETWORK LARAVEL INSTALLER END ////
  ```
  **Note:** The `KYNAR NETWORK` comments must remain to facilitate removal at the end of the installation process.

#### **Step 3: Start Installation**
You can begin the installation in one of two ways:
- Access the `/setup/` directory directly.
- Visit your website‚Äîif the setup process is required, you will be redirected automatically.

#### **Step 4: Follow the Installation Wizard**
Proceed through the guided installation process:
1. Welcome screen
2. System requirements check
3. Dependencies installation
4. Database configuration
5. Website information setup
6. Admin account creation
7. Installation completion

#### **Step 5: Review Installation Summary**
Ensure all configurations and installations were completed successfully before finalizing the setup.

#### **Step 6: Finalize the Setup**
Click the **Complete** button on the final setup page. This action will:
- Remove the previously inserted code from `public/index.php`.
- Attempt to delete the `/setup/` directory.

If the `/setup/` directory is not automatically removed, delete it manually.

Once completed, you can now access your Laravel application.
